# CPP_PRALLEL_CORPUS
We introduce a new parallel corpus for the C-Plus-Plus language .

A parallel corpus comprising of a code snippet and the corresponding natural language description can be of great advantage. This can be used for creating several useful productivity tools like code generation, code completion, code summarization, CODE SEARCH etc. We see many such parallel corpus for the languages like Java, python, golang, JavaScript, BASH what we propose is to prepare one such corpus for c++ programming language. 
We would be specifically targeting the code summarization task i.e. given a code the model is required to generate a natural language description of it.
